        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>I do love listening to music but I don't tend to enjoy composing it myself, so I figured that a field recording would be the better option for this project. I wanted make meaning and learn from the recording much like Steven Feld did with his recordings of the Bufo regularis. The tools that I had available to me included Audacity with its arsenal of audio effects and a music visualizer that I coded this past summer. With these tools, I decided that I could apply various effects to the recording, hear how they might give new meanings to the recording, and also use the visualizer to see how they affect the frequencies of the recording. For the subject of the recording, I chose the sound of a T train arriving, a sound that is very characteristic of Boston’s urban environment. The majority of the recording consists of mechanical ambiance and noises, but there are a couple more recognizable sounds as well, including a person talking on the phone, various dings, and automated announcements. These sounds, being more recognizable, are the best for comparing between the different versions of the recording.</p>
        <p>The first effect I used was Audacity’s “Change Speed” function. With this I made two new versions of the recording, one that was slowed down by 50% and one that was sped up by 30%. As one would expect, the frequencies of the recognizable sounds in slowed down version are lowered slightly which is reflected by the visualizer. However for some reason, the act of slowing down the recording also accentuated a lot of high frequency screech-like noises from the train. As a result, you can see a lot more activity on the higher frequency side which I would not have expected from a slowed down recording. This version already sounds pretty nightmarish due to the slower, pitched down talking and dings, but the addition of the high-pitched noise makes the whole recording a very unpleasant and jarring listen. </p>
        <p>The sped-up version is a much nice experience. It’s a third of the length of the slower one and has no awful screeching. As with the slower version, the visualizer reflects the slightly higher frequencies of the more recognizable sounds in this version. You can also see the increased speed in the movement of the visualizer. The sound of this version has an almost jolly quality to it, as if it’s actually a recording of a train station for little elves. This starkly contrasts the slowed-down version which sounds like it was taken out of a horror movie.</p>
        <p>Next, I wanted to focus on an effect that has nothing to do with time or pitch, so I chose delay. With this effect, there is no real change in frequency, but you can see the pulsing nature of the sounds in the visualizer. Due to delay and echo’s prevalence in psychedelic and/or otherworldly music and film, any sound byte will most likely sound more dreamlike when it’s run through these effects. My T recording is no exception. The delay makes the whooshing of the wind and the rumbling of the train sound much more overwhelming and stranger, as if you’re falling down the rabbit hole in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, but the hole is a mineshaft instead. Overall, it just sounds like part of some dream sequence which probably has much more to do with the effect itself than the contents of the recording.</p>
        <p>The last effect I tried was Paulstretch which is my favorite from Audacity’s bank. It basically takes a sound byte and stretches it out by some factor, turning anything into an ominous ambient soundscape. The effect is similar to slowing it down, but there are unique embellishments added to make the result sound truly otherworldly, more so than delay could. The stretch factor I used was rather small but it still inflated the 30-second recording to an almost 3-minute runtime. Every high-pitched squeak of the train blends into each other to form a constant hissing. It becomes much more difficult to pick out the once easily recognizable sounds because they're all transformed into spooky drones. Any semblance of earthly noise is gone, the recording now sounds like what you might hear in some far off, alien dimension. Here again, the interpretation of the altered recording does not have much to do with the actual content of the recording itself. As for the visualization of this version, one can see that most of the action takes place in the lower frequencies with the exception of the occasional screech or ding. Similar to the change speed versions, with this version, you can again see the slowness of the recording reflected in the movement of the visualizer. I always find it fascinating how drastically Paulstretch warps a sound clip despite how simple the concept of it is.</p>
        <p>Steven Feld defines acoustemology as “an inquiry into what is knowable, and how it becomes known, through sounding and listening” (Feld 93). Although my findings from this project are far less profound than the results of Feld’s work with the Bufo toad, I still think my work here qualifies as acoustemology. I took a piece of my everyday soundtrack, messed around with it on my computer, analyzed the results, and ended up learning a few things in the end. I found out what is knowable from applying audio effects to a recording of the T and listening to the results. It was an enjoyable and intriguing exercise. It's great that free tools like Audacity exist and allow anyone with a computer to dip their toes into the world of acoustemology.</p>

		<p>For my project, I interviewed my uncle, John Leister. He is a Juilliard-trained percussionist with a diverse career history that includes touring with Little Shop of Horrors and Metallica, playing on Broadway, directing high school marching bands, teaching private drum lessons, and running multiple elementary schools as their principal. Being the most musically-inclined member of my family, he has been the biggest supporter and influence on both my cousins’ as well as mine and my brother’s musical endeavors. I remember when I picked up my first musical instrument (trombone) right before joining band in fourth grade, he was the one who showed me how to put it together and play it for the very first time. Through my interview, I wanted to learn more about his motivations, inspirations, and musical identity.</p>
		<p>It seems like some of the main inspirations behind John’s initial interest in music were the people close to him. Both of his parents were musicians, so it was likely inevitable that he would pick something up. He started off playing trumpet because his “father played trumpet a lot in the house”. Then, when he showed an interest in drumming, his father brought home drumsticks, a pad, and a snare drum from his school. John’s father made learning drums so much easier for him just like he made learning trombone so much easier for me. It seems like often, musical interest is passed down through a family like it’s genetic. None of my cousins are pursing a career in music, but I know one of them still participates in drum circles and other musical activities within the Latin music scene in Albuquerque. Plus, I’m adding a Music Industry minor to my degree and my brother is very active with a cappella, musical theater, and the jazz band at his college, so John’s musical lineage is definitely carrying on.</p>
		<p>Tia DeNora talks a lot about “finding the ‘me in music’” in her “Music as a technology of the self” paper. I, myself, am not much of a musician but I listen to a whole lot of music. I see my own eccentric personality traits reflected in my eccentric music taste similar to how DeNora’s subject, Lucy sees her personality traits reflected in her affinity for “lower sonorities” (DeNora 50). Going into the interview, I wanted to find out if a musician’s personality traits translate to their musical process or values. For John, they definitely do. He mentioned how as he’s become more experienced, he has “learned how to play more with people and match their color and their phrasing, so it's more of a musical unit or musical team”. Knowing John, this makes a lot of sense because he is a very collaborative person. It seems like he is always leading something, whether that is a marching band, a school, or our church (where he is currently the council president). Leadership roles like these require an immense amount of collaboration and coordination just as playing in an orchestra or band does. He is one of the most outgoing people I know and will start a conversation with anyone, so he definitely loves working with other people. Going back to the music taste examples, these personality traits of John’s also inform his regular listening habits. He told me that he likes to listen to jazz trios and quartets because they emphasize “blending with people, playing a groove, improvising”. Here again, it is evident that John places a lot of value on the ability to work together with other musicians. Being a collaborative person, he is drawn towards music that is collaborative in nature just as Lucy, being someone who does not enjoy the limelight, is drawn towards vocal parts that hang in the background of a song.</p>
		<p>Overall, it was very enlightening to have such an in-depth conversation with my uncle. I enjoyed learning about his beginnings as a percussionist and who inspired him back then. In addition to his father, the West Point jazz and concert bands also gave him an example of what a career in music looks like and ultimately played a significant part in his decision to pursue percussion in college. Nowadays he still looks up to figures like Steve Gadd and Yo-Yo Ma. As I mentioned before, a piece of music contains reflects the identity of its creator, but it also reflects the identities of their influences. I’m always fascinated to learn who inspires my favorite musicians; each one gets you one step closer to solving their musical puzzle. It was great to learn about a few more pieces of my uncle’s puzzle. I think another one of the most enlightening parts of the interview was the end when we talked about why he does what he does. He told me that every gig he does, no matter how small, makes the lives of the people involved at least a little bit better, citing the musical at my old high school as an example. If the students “all get excited about musical theater and singing and playing,” then that’s a success in his book. I think this is a very refreshing outlook on the motivations behind music creation given the greedy, selfish, and exorbitant image that the music industry and its biggest players have today. There are certainly outliers, we discussed in class how hard Lady Gaga tries (successfully) to connect with listeners who may feel like outsiders in today’s society. However, I think most musical giants and the businesses that support them have a long way to go towards a musical motivation that’s as selfless as my uncle’s.</p>

		<h3>Transcription</h3>
		<p><strong>Spencer: Ok I think we're good. So first question. I want to start by talking about the history of you as a musician. So what first inspired you to pick up an instrument?</strong></p>
		<p>John: So my parents were both musicians and my father played trumpet a lot in the house. We had a lot of music being played all the time, records and stuff. And so I wanted to start an instrument you know in fourth grade. I played my dad's instrument which was trumpet.</p>
		<p><strong>And then how did you go from trumpet to percussion?</strong></p>
		<p>So I was not the greatest trumpet player and my lips and teeth were better suited for trombone. So I switched to trombone in fifth grade, and then played in school band and whatever. But I was more interested in other things, interested in sports and I want to be an architect. So I dropped out of band great in eight grade. I quit and that was it, my parents were ok with it. And then we went to a Chinese restaurant, for the first time ever, I guess right at the end of my eighth grade year and I brought chopsticks back, put some tape on the end and started playing, just like banging around in my room. So my father brought home a pair of drumsticks and a pad from his school. And so I started playing a lot on the pad and then he brought back a snare drum from school. I started playing on that and then I had saved up a bunch of money as a paper boy, so I bought my first used drum set. Then I joined band in ninth grade, right before the school year started and played drums in marching band and trombone in concert band. Sophomore year, I switched to all drums.</p>
		<p><strong>How did you make the decision to make percussion your career and study it in college?</strong></p>
		<p>You know I specifically remember a moment in fourth or fifth grade band when our band director said we're short a drummer on a piece, would anyone be interested in drums? And I raised my hand because to me, that was like the coolest thing ever, I remember that. I wasn't picked. As a trumpet player, he needed me to play trumpet. So I remember that specific moment. And then when I was in high school we went to West Point about once a month and we saw a lot of concerts up there and that's when I really thought, hey that looks like it's fun to do. It was the West Point jazz band and the West Point concert band.</p>
		<p><strong>The next thing I want to talk about is your musical process. So when you're going into a piece and you have to learn it, what's your process?</strong></p>
		<p>Well a lot of what I do is playing an orchestral piece, something from the orchestral repertoire. So I will get the music, my individual percussion part, I'll get the score, the conductor’s score, and then I will listen to at least three recordings of it. And after I've learned the piece and learned the sound that I want and studied the piece enough, then I'll actually play along with either YouTube videos or other recordings that I have. So the first time I go in, I’m very prepared. I'm not really learning on the job as much as I'm learning before I get there. And one other thing, if I'm learning a drum set thing for a show, ragtime group, choral performance, jazz performance, or whatever, then I'll set up the equipment that I'm gonna need and use in the house and then practice that individual setup. Like now I'm doing this show, and so I had to create a setup in my house so I knew where things were because there's a concert bass drum, there’s a bell tree, glockenspiel, different instruments. And right now I'm working on some silent films, and so the same thing, I set up all my sound effects to sort of mimic what it's going to be when I get to the gig.</p>
		<p><strong>What do you think that you, John Leister bring to an ensemble that no other percussionist can?</strong></p>
		<p>Well what they told us at Juilliard was basically, when you play any concert, you want to make it the best performance of that piece that's ever happened. So if it's Beethoven 5, you want to be the best sounding timpanist that's ever played it. It's sort of this really, really high standard. So I try and live up to that. I'm definitely a little bit OCD and a little bit nerdish about details, having the exact stick, having the right sound, the right color. And as I've gotten older, I've learned how to play more with people and match their color and their phrasing, so it's more of a musical unit or musical team. When I was younger, I just listened to myself, I didn’t really have any ears. I think my ears have gotten a lot better as I've gotten more experience and also I've been in more experiences, so I think I'm a little bit more calm.</p>
		<p><strong>Do your or did you ever write your own music?</strong></p>
		<p>I was a piano minor in college. I was playing a lot of piano, so that led me to write some pieces. I wrote a piece for a woman with a three-syllable name. That is one of my classic compositions. I hadn't met her yet but I always told people if I meet somebody with a name like Betty Lou or Margaret Ann or Josie Q. And my wife's name is Karen Leigh so it all worked out. And then I've arranged pieces for marching band when I was marching band teacher, I arranged a lot of things for percussion ensemble, and for my students. I used to write a solo for each one of my private students that was custom for them, their name, things they were working on.</p>
		<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about your music writing process, if you have one?</strong></p>
		<p>Yeah I mean I'm not a composer, I would never claim to be a composer, I’m maybe just sort of a hack who never studied composing. But I think like anything, you kind of think of form from a big standpoint, more of a global picture and then you have some smaller ideas within the form. I definitely think of both rhythm and melody but I think it's fair to say that rhythm drives my melody more than the other way around.</p>
		<p><strong>So what other musicians, whether your peers or someone famous have inspired you the most?</strong></p>
		<p>I think just people I've seen live or heard recordings of like Steve Gadd. I try and aspire to sound like him because I've never heard him sound tense, never heard him rush or push. Just the flow of his sound, the groove, his touch. He’s somebody who I've never worked with, who I think about, watch on recordings and I've heard live a couple times. But I've also learned a lot from people I've played with. Being in New York City, I get to play with these incredible musicians. I’ve learned a lot from standing next to them or in the same orchestra as them or behind them or if they’re a soloist with us like Yo-Yo Ma. I’ve learned a lot from him. Just being close to these great minds and great ears as well as some phenomenal conductors. I'll sit in an orchestra and kind of think about, ok we just played this portion of a piece, what would I address if I was the conductor and then I observe and see what they go for and what they pick out. So I've learned a lot from just being in the same room with great, great, great players.</p>
		<p><strong>What are your music listening habits like just in the day-to-day?</strong></p>
		<p>Yeah so I listen to a lot of jazz primarily. I like to listen to small groups: trios and quartets. I gravitate more towards 60s, 70s, 80s somewhat. As for pop music, I listen to a lot of R&B. For me, that’s it.</p>
		<p><strong>How does any of that inform your musicianship if it does?</strong></p>
		<p>Well it does because again, when we’re talking about blending with people, playing a groove, improvising, those are the people I'm listening to and trying to sound like. I think a lot of orchestral players, at least when I was going to college, didn't play drum set, so they didn't understand time and groove. They didn’t play congas or bongos and they didn't listen to a lot of Latin music. That's changed now, more students are doing everything and playing everything which I think makes you a better orchestral player. So I think that’s something that has really helped me—drum set groove and even improvisation—to be a better orchestral player and a better Broadway player.</p>
		<p><strong>What is your dream gig?</strong></p>
		<p>Well I would say my dream gigs continue to be playing with amazing musicians. So whether it's a jazz quartet playing at Shanghai [Jazz in Madison, NJ] or at a high-end wedding, or playing with a great orchestra like St. Luke's or American Ballet Theatre in the last year, I'm playing my dream gigs luckily. I'm playing with the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra next week in Indiana and Missouri and that's a dream gig for me because it's just incredible players, mostly young, New York, phenomenal players. And the conductor’s great, super high standards, nice groove. It's not too loud, it doesn't hurt my ears. It's all acoustic. Plus, I get to do sound effects for films which is great. That's what I was doing when you walked in, I was watching a silent movie. So I guess those are my dream gigs. I mean, I do enjoy playing in New York City and New Jersey because the level of playing is so high, the ensembles and symphonies are so great. </p>
		<p>It's also a dream gig for me to teach. Just as much as I enjoy playing, I enjoy teaching, it's completely the same. It's a different feeling, but in terms of my enjoyment, it's a dream gig for me. So I still love teaching high school, college, middle school, elementary school, five and six year olds.</p>
		<p><strong>If you can make music with anyone dead or alive, who would it be?</strong></p>
		<p>Ok so Bill Evans on piano, Christian McBride on bass. So that would be the dream trio. Christian McBride is still living. Dream orchestra would be to play with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Holland under Bernard Haitink, the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell, or the U.S. Marine Band under John Philip Sousa. I’ve never been to New Orleans, but one of my dreams is to play with musicians from there because that groove is something else. And to play in a salsa band because again, that groove is like a whole other bag. So to be good in different areas of percussion and to be at that level would be something really fun for me, really challenging.</p>
		<p><strong>What are some of your proudest musical achievements?</strong></p>
		<p>As a teacher, I would say, building great music programs in two public schools where we had a huge number of participants; over half of the school was in the band and enjoying music and excited about it, playing well, practicing, getting better. So that that has been an achievement. As a principal, running a good strong school that focused on kindness and respect, focused on literacy, focused on numeracy, focused on getting excited about learning. As a musician, I would say over the past twenty-five years of playing with the orchestra of St. Luke's in the city, I'm pretty proud of those performances and just feel very, very fortunate and grateful to be called for those gigs.</p>
		<p><strong>You might’ve answered this already but why do you do what you do? That’ll be my closing question.</strong></p>
		<p>Well I think I can make the world a little better place either through teaching or playing. Even the thing I'm doing tonight which is playing drums at a high school musical, hopefully it'll be a really high level and those kids all get excited about musical theater and singing and playing. Next week when I'm on the road with Paragon, I think we'll be offering some really great performances for people to make their lives better. And again, no phones, no electronics, they're going to come and hear a live performance and watch some silent films, well that will be electronic. I think just through teaching and performing, making other people's lives better, maybe a little bit happier and more fulfilled. You know, as a musician, that life is very rich when you're a musician. There’s always great music to listen to, to learn, to go see concerts for and I can't imagine a life without that. It would sort of be like a life without interesting food. Grilled cheese every day, it's fine but it's not amazing. So if I can help students learn how great music enhances their lives, and as a performer, be on the frontline enhancing people’s lives, then that’s it.</p>

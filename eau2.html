        The primary focus of my Software Development class was implementing this distributed key/value store which I did with a classmate. It's kind of like a much simpler version of Apache Spark written in C.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example applications that the professors gave us to run include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A simple demo that calculates a large sum, stores it on one eau2 node, recalculates it on another node, and compares both sums on a third. This application was used to smoke test our implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                An application that counts the number of occurrences of words read from a text file.
            </li>
            <li>
                An application that analyzes files containing GitHub data from the Linux code repository and calculates the degrees of separation from any given contributor to Linus Torvalds.
            </li>
        </ul>
